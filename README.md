# Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

## Introduction

The rapid spread of misinformation online has made fake news detection an increasingly important problem in machine learning and natural language processing. False or misleading news articles can influence public opinion, amplify social division, and undermine trust in legitimate media sources. As digital platforms continue to become primary channels for news consumption, scalable and automated methods for identifying fake news are becoming increasingly essential.

In this project, we investigate whether machine learning models can accurately distinguish between **real news** and **fake news** based solely on article text. We formulate this as a **binary classification problem**, where each article is labeled as either:

- **0 = Real News**
- **1 = Fake News**

Our goal is to compare multiple machine learning approaches for fake news detection and evaluate their predictive performance, robustness, and practical strengths and limitations.

To accomplish this, we explore a range of modeling strategies, including traditional supervised classification models, transformer-based language models, and anomaly detection methods. By comparing these approaches, we aim to better understand which techniques are most effective for automated fake news detection.

## Dataset

For this project, we use the **WELFake Dataset**, a publicly available dataset for fake news classification.

### Source

- Dataset: WELFake Dataset
- Platform: Kaggle
- Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/fake-news-classification
- Creator: Saurabh Shahane

The WELFake dataset was created by combining several existing fake news and real news datasets into a single large corpus for binary text classification. The goal of the dataset is to support research on automated fake news detection using machine learning and natural language processing techniques.

### Features

The original dataset contains the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `title` | Headline of the news article |
| `text` | Main body text of the article |
| `label` | Binary label for classification (`0 = Real`, `1 = Fake`) |

For our modeling pipeline, we primarily use the **article text (`text`)** as the predictive feature and the **label** as the target variable.

### Data Size

The raw dataset contains approximately **72,000+ news articles**, making it sufficiently large for supervised learning models.

After preprocessing, our final dataset size is reduced due to:

- removal of missing values
- removal of duplicated articles
- removal of URLs and formatting artifacts
- filtering out extremely short articles
- text normalization and cleaning

This ensures higher data quality and reduces noise in downstream modeling.

### Data Collection Background and Limitations

Because WELFake is an aggregated dataset compiled from multiple news datasets, it contains writing styles, topics, and publication sources from a variety of outlets. This diversity is helpful for building generalized fake news detection models.

However, this also introduces several challenges:

- **Source bias**: certain publishers may have consistent writing patterns that models can overfit to
- **Labeling bias**: article labels depend on the original source datasets and may contain inconsistencies
- **Temporal drift**: writing styles and misinformation strategies evolve over time
- **Dataset artifacts**: formatting tokens, media references, and duplicated content may leak signals unrelated to factual accuracy

These limitations should be considered when interpreting model performance.

## TF-IDF-based Models

### Methodology

We use **TF-IDF vectorization** to convert cleaned news articles into numerical feature representations suitable for machine learning classification.

Compared to dense embedding methods such as SBERT, TF-IDF produces a sparse representation that emphasizes informative words and short phrases while reducing the influence of overly common terms.

Our analysis evaluates the following classifiers on top of TF-IDF features:

- Logistic Regression
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- XGBoost

Each model is assessed using **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-score**, and **ROC-AUC**.

## SBERT-based Models

### Method

We use Sentence-BERT (SBERT) to obtain dense semantic representations of news articles. Compared to traditional feature-based methods such as TF-IDF, SBERT captures contextual and semantic information at the sentence level.


We evaluate the following classifiers on top of SBERT embeddings:

- Logistic Regression  
- XGBoost  
- Gaussian Naive Bayes

### Implementation

We use the pre-trained model: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (available at: https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) 


Key settings:

- Embedding dimension: 384  
- Batch size: 32

### Analysis

SBERT-based models achieve strong performance, with Logistic Regression and XGBoost reaching accuracy around 86% and ROC-AUC above 0.93.

In contrast, Gaussian Naive Bayes performs substantially worse, with accuracy dropping to around 73%.

This gap can be explained by the underlying assumptions of the model:

- Gaussian Naive Bayes assumes **feature independence**  
- It also assumes each feature follows a **Gaussian distribution**

However, SBERT embeddings are:

- **high-dimensional**
- **dense and correlated across dimensions**
- **not Gaussian-distributed**

As a result, the assumptions of Naive Bayes are strongly violated, leading to degraded performance.

From the confusion matrix, GaussianNB produces:

- significantly more **false positives**
- and more **false negatives**

indicating weaker class separation compared to Logistic Regression and XGBoost.

Overall, this highlights that:

> **model assumptions must align with representation structure** and that not all classifiers are suitable for dense semantic embeddings.
